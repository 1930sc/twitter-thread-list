# twitter-thread-list

A tool to find your most popular Twitter threads. [Here’s an example from my data](https://aresluna.org/twitter-threads).

## Instructions

1. [Request your Twitter data](https://twitter.com/settings/your_twitter_data)  (this might take some time – you will get an email whenever that’s ready – so do this first).

2. [Install Node](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)

3. Clone or copy this script to your computer.

4. Unpack your Twitter data once you got it.

5. Run the script by providing the directory where the files reside, e.g.: 

`node generate-thread-list.js /~/Downloads/twitter-2018-11-25-501cabffd3e92d9a0ff16656406`

## Result

Open `thread-list.html` in your browser.

**OR**

Get the generated `thread-list.json` and use it in some other way.
